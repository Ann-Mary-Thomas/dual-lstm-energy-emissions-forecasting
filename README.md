# Dual LSTM: Joint Forecasting of U.S. Electricity Demand and CO₂ Emissions

This repository contains the code and notebooks for my MSc research paper on **joint forecasting of national electricity demand and CO₂ emissions using a dual-output LSTM network.**  
The project explores the inherent link between electricity demand, generation mix, and resulting emissions, delivering accurate predictions and actionable insights for renewable integration and grid planning.

## 🔍 Abstract

Accurate forecasting of electricity demand and CO₂ emissions is crucial for effective grid planning, emissions mitigation, and the integration of renewable energy.  
This study develops a dual-output long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on six years (2018–2023) of U.S. hourly EIA-930 data to jointly predict electricity demand and CO₂ emissions.  
The model achieves MAPE of 1.24% (demand) and 3.21% (emissions) on test data, successfully capturing seasonal and operational patterns.  
Scenario-based simulations increasing solar penetration (10%–50%) reveal a consistent decline in forecasted CO₂ emissions, averaging a 3.89% reduction at 50% solar share.  
Explainable AI techniques (SHAP analysis) further highlight key drivers: net generation, lagged demand, and fuel mix proportions.  
This framework combines accurate joint forecasting, renewable integration scenarios, and explainable insights to support data-driven energy transition planning.
